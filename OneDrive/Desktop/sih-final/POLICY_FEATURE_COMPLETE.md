# ‚úÖ Policy Context Feature - Complete

## What Was Added

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive **Policy Context System** for your eConsultation platform. Now administrators and users can see exactly what policy they're commenting on, and all feedback is automatically linked to specific policies for better AI analysis.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Policy Display Component**
- Beautiful blue-gradient card at the top of the dashboard
- Shows policy title, description, status, category, version
- Expandable full policy text viewer (scrollable, 600px max)
- Displays feedback count and last updated date
- "Read Full Policy" button to expand/collapse
- Print policy button for saving/printing
- Call-to-action message encouraging feedback

### 2. **Policy Management API**
- Complete RESTful API for policies
- Endpoints for list, get, create, update status
- Get current active policy endpoint
- Automatic feedback counting per policy

### 3. **Database Integration**
- New `Policy` model with full relationship to `Feedback`
- Each feedback is now linked to a specific policy via `policyId`
- Track which comments are for which policy

### 4. **AI Context Integration**
- Feedback submissions include policy context
- Policy Sandbox now pre-loads current policy text
- AI features can reference specific policy when analyzing

### 5. **Sample Policy Data**
- Comprehensive CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) policy amendment
- Real-world example: Companies Act 2013 - Section 135
- Includes proposed changes, timelines, penalties, stakeholder consultation
