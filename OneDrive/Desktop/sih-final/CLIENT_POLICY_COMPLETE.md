# ✅ Client-Side Policy Context - COMPLETE

## What Was Done

I've successfully implemented the **client-side policy context feature** so users can see the policy they're commenting on and their feedback is automatically linked for AI analysis.

## 🎯 Key Features Added

### 1. **Policy Display on Client Dashboard**
- Policy context card shows at top of `/client/dashboard`
- Users see: Title, Description, Status, Category, Version
- "Read Full Policy" button expands full policy text
- Scrollable container (600px max height)

### 2. **Automatic Policy Linking**
- Every feedback submission includes `policyId`
- Backend stores the relationship
- AI can reference policy when analyzing

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Dynamic placeholder shows policy title in textarea
- Green checkmark with "linked to policy" message
- Success notification after submission
- Loading states and error handling

### 4. **AI Context Integration**
- Feedback + Policy context saved together
- AI features can query by policy
- Better sentiment analysis
